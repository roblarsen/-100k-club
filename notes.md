data notes:

- Vintage Comics X-men #1 CGC 9.6 OWW for $175,000 in 2011 to Metro. That book subsequently resold about a year or maybe less for $200,000.
- WM FF 1 just sold again on Heritage (although I`m too lazy to look it up).
- The 9.6 Showcase #4 was from the Newsboy collection.
- I think you`re missing some recent public sales of TOS 39 and JIM 83 that were above $100K.
- I can`t disclose the exact price, but the 9.4 Brave and Bold sold in November 2009 for over $100K. 
- 2002. Geppi paid $40k for the MC #1 Pay Copy + a copy of MPFW in the 80s. I happened to notice awhile back that this happened far enough into the internet era that there's still live links. Here's a fun blast from the past... http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-01...ppi-human-torch

- Hello, I don't see on your list the Action Comics #1- Court Copy, cgc 6.5 Mod(P), which sold on Heritage at 140K. The highest restored comic book sale in history and it carry's a historical significance and provenance.
