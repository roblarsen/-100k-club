# D3/TypeScript Boilerplate

## Getting Started 

v1.0.0-alpha release

## Getting Started

Clone or download the project and then run

``` 
npm install
npm run start
```
And then you can edit `index.ts` which already imports D3 and writes a small
SVG element into the page. 

The project is also available on npm:

```
npm i d3-ts-boilerplate

```

Then the files will be available in `node_modules/d3-ts-boilerplate/`
